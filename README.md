### About me
I have study many years of bioinformatics (mathematics, biology, chemistry, data analysis, statistics), business administration and economics. I love to structure data that are unstructured and right now I am trying to learn more about machine learning (I have a bachelor degree with the help of a supervised learning method and a master degree with the help of an unsupervised learning).
